# Research Questions

The Massachusetts Education Reform Act in 1993 was passed in the context
of a national movement toward education reform throughout the United
States. As early as 1989 there were calls to establish national
curriculum standards as a way to improve student college and career
readiness skills and close poverty gaps [@Greer18]. Massachusetts
Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) tests were introduced as part of
the Massachusetts Education Reform Act.

The MCAS tests are a significant tool for educational equity. Scores on
the Grade 10 Math MCAS test "predict longer-term educational attainments
and labor market success, above and beyond typical markers of student
advantage. For example, among demographically similar students who
attended the same high school and have the same level of ultimate
educational attainment, those with higher MCAS mathematics scores go on
to have much higher average earnings than those with lower scores."
[@Boats20].

With the introduction of the new Common Core standards came the demand
for appropriate curricular materials and teaching practices. Research
indicates that the choice of instructional materials can have an impact
"as large as or larger than the impact of teacher quality" [@Blindly12].
Massachusetts, along with Arkansas, Delaware, Kentucky, Louisiana,
Maryland, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Mexico, Ohio, Rhode Island,
Tennessee and Texas belongs to the Council of Chief State School
Officers' (CCSO), [High Quality Instructional Materials and Professional
Development
network](https://learning.ccsso.org/high-quality-instructional-materials)
with the stated goal of ensuring that "Every student everyday is engaged
in meaningful, affirming, grade-level instruction, by ensuring that
every teacher has access to high-quality, standards aligned
instructional materials and receives relevant professional development
to support their use of these materials, and recently released a [Case
Study](https://753a0706.flowpaper.com/CCSSOIMPDCaseStudyOVERVIEWFINAL/#page=3)
outlining progress and policy guidance for ensuring teachers and
students have access to High Quality Instructional Materials.

Since all Massachusetts students must pass a High School science MCAS
and school's receive annual reports on student performance on the MCAS
exams, student performance reports could be leveraged to provide schools
guidance on curricular areas to support.

considering Next Generation MCAS High School Introductory Physics
student performance data, we hope to address the following broad
questions:

```{=html}
<style>
div.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;}
</style>
```
::: blue
-   Is there a relationship between differences in student performance
    across Science Practice Categories and student achievement?

-   How can trends in student performance be used to identify
    Introductory Physics content areas in need of curricular
    adjustments?
:::

In this report, I will analyze the High School Introductory Physics Next
Generation [Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System
(MCAS)](https://www.doe.mass.edu/mcas/default.html) tests results for
Massachusetts public schools.

The `HSPhy_NextGenMCASDF` data frame contains performance results from
112 public schools across the commonwealth on the Next Generation High
School Introductory Physics MCAS, which was administered in the Spring
of 2022 and 2023.

For each school, there are values reported for 256 different variables
which consist of information from two broad categories

-   *School Characteristics*: This includes the name of the school and
    the size of the school as determined by the number of students that
    completed the MCAS exam.

-   *Science Practice and Reporting Category Performance Metrics*: This
    includes the `Category Possible Points`, which summarizes the amount
    of points available on the exams from a given Reporting or Practice
    category, the school's percentage of points earned on items
    associated with each `Practice Category` (A. Investigations and
    Questioning, B. Mathematics and Data, and C. Evidence, Reasoning,
    and Modeling ) and `Reporting Category`(MF (motion and forces) WA
    (waves), and EN (energy)). Details about the Science content and
    practice categories can be found in the the [2016 STE Massachusetts
    Curriculum
    Framework](https://www.doe.mass.edu/frameworks/scitech/2016-04.pdf).

-   *Aggregate Performance metrics*: This includes a school's percentage
    of students at each of the four `Performance Levels`, (E: Exceeding
    Expectations, M: Meeting Expectations, PM: Partially Meeting
    Expectations, and NM: Not Meeting Expectations), as well as a
    school's Average Scaled Score.

-   *School-State Diff metrics*: For each performance metric, the
    `School-State Diff` metric reports the difference between the
    percentage of points earned by students at a given school,
    `School Percent Points` and the percentage of available points
    earned by students in the state `State Percent Points`.

See the `HSPhy_NextGenMCASDF` data frame summary and **codebook** for
further details.

# Hypothesis

```{=html}
<style>
div.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;}
</style>
```
::: blue
-   A school's percent of student's exceeding expectations on the
    Introductory Physics MCAS is negatively associated with variance in
    Mathematics and Data items.

-   School's mean performance diffs are not the same across science
    practice categories.

# Descriptive Statistics

Data of 112 schools performance on Next Generation HS Introductory
Physics exam in Spring of 2022 and Spring of 2023. 87 of those schools
tested students in both years and 25 of those schools only tested
students in 1 of the 2 testing years.
