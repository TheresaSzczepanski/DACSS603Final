The MCAS tests are a significant tool for educational equity. Scores on the Grade 10 Math MCAS test “predict longer-term educational attainments and labor market success, above and beyond typical markers of student advantage. For example, among demographically similar students who attended the same high school and have the same level of ultimate educational attainment, those with higher MCAS mathematics scores go on to have much higher average earnings than those with lower scores.” (Papay et. al, 2020 pp 7-10)\nIn this report, I will analyze the Spring 2022 MCAS Results for students completing the High School Introductory Physics MCAS at Rising Tide Charter Public School.\nThe MCAS_2022 data frame contains performance results from 495 students from Rising Tide on the Spring 2022 Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) tests.\nFor each student, there are values reported for 256 different variables which consist of information from four broad categories\n\nDemographic characteristics of the students themselves (e.g., race, gender, date of birth, town, grade level, years in school, years in Massachusetts, and low income, title1, IEP, 504, and EL status ).\nKey assessment features including subject, test format, and accommodations provided\nPerformance metrics: This includes a student’s score on individual item strands, e.g.,sitem1-sitem42.\n\nSee the MCAS_2022 data frame summary and codebook in the appendix for further details.\nThe second data set, SG9_Item, is \\(42 \\times 9\\) and consists of 9 variables with information pertaining to the 42 questions on the 2022 HS Introductory Physics Item Report. The variables can be broken down into 2 categories:\nDetails about the content of a given test item:\nThis includes the content Reporting Category (MF (motion and forces) WA (waves), and EN (energy)), the Standard from the 2016 STE Massachusetts Curriculum Framework, the Item Description providing the details of what specifically was asked of students, and the points available for a given question, item Possible Points.\nSummary Performance Metrics:\n\nFor each item, the state reports the percentage of points earned by students at Rising Tide, RT Percent Points, the percentage of available points earned by students in the state, State Percent Points, and the difference between the percentage of points earned by Rising Tide students and the percentage of points earned by students in the state, RT-State Diff.\nLastly, SG9_CU306Dis and SG9_CU306NonDis are \\(3 \\times 5\\) dataframes consisting of summary performance data by Reporting Category for students with disabilities and without disabilities; most importantly including RT Percent Points and State Percent Pointsby disability status.\n\nWhen considering our student performance data, we hope to address the following broad questions:\n\n\n\nWhat adjustments (if any) should be made at the Tier 1 level, i.e., curricular adjustments for all students in the General Education setting?\nWhat would be the most beneficial areas of focus for a targeted intervention course for students struggling to meet or exceed performance expectations?\nAre there notable differences in student performance for students with and without disabilities?"
