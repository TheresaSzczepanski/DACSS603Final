The MCAS tests are a significant tool for educational equity. Scores on the Grade 10 Math MCAS test “predict longer-term educational attainments and labor market success, above and beyond typical markers of student advantage. For example, among demographically similar students who attended the same high school and have the same level of ultimate educational attainment, those with higher MCAS mathematics scores go on to have much higher average earnings than those with lower scores.” (Papy 2020).\nThe Massachusetts Education Reform Act in 1993 was passed in the context of a national movement toward education reform throughout the United States. As early as 1989 there were calls to establish national curriculum standards as a way to improve student college and career readiness skills and close poverty gaps (Greer, 2018, 106). With the introduction of the new Common Core standards came the demand for appropriate curricular materials and teaching practices. Four out of five math teachers in five studied states, including Massachusetts, reported changing more than half of their instructional materials in response to the Common Core (Kane et al., 2016). Most United States public schools use commercially produced instructional materials with an estimated 70 to 98 percent of teachers using textbooks at least weekly (Brown Center on Educational Policy at Brookings et al., 2012). Research indicates that the choice of instructional materials can have an impact “as large as or larger than the impact of teacher quality” (Brown Center on Educational Policy at Brookings et al., 2012).\nMassachusetts, along with Arkansas, Delaware, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Mexico, Ohio, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Texas belongs to the Council of Chief State School Officers’ (CCSO), High Quality Instructional Materials and Professional Development network with the stated goal of ensuring that “Every student everyday is engaged in meaningful, affirming, grade-level instruction, by ensuring that every teacher has access to high-quality, standards aligned instructional materials and receives relevant professional development to support their use of these materials. Case Study\nIn DESE’s\nWhen considering Next Generation MCAS High School Introductory Physics student performance data, we hope to address the following broad questions:\n\n\n\nIs there a relationship between differences in student performance across Science Practice Categories and student acheivement?\nHow can trends in student performance be used to identify Introductory Physics content areas in need of curricular adjustments?\n\n\nIn this report, I will analyze the Spring 2022 MCAS Results for students completing the High School Introductory Physics MCAS at Rising Tide Charter Public School.\nThe MCAS_2022 data frame contains performance results from 495 students from Rising Tide on the Spring 2022 Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) tests.\nFor each student, there are values reported for 256 different variables which consist of information from four broad categories\n\nDemographic characteristics of the students themselves (e.g., race, gender, date of birth, town, grade level, years in school, years in Massachusetts, and low income, title1, IEP, 504, and EL status ).\nKey assessment features including subject, test format, and accommodations provided\nPerformance metrics: This includes a student’s score on individual item strands, e.g.,sitem1-sitem42.\n\nSee the MCAS_2022 data frame summary and codebook in the appendix for further details.\nThe second data set, SG9_Item, is \\(42 \\times 9\\) and consists of 9 variables with information pertaining to the 42 questions on the 2022 HS Introductory Physics Item Report. The variables can be broken down into 2 categories:\nDetails about the content of a given test item:\nThis includes the content Reporting Category (MF (motion and forces) WA (waves), and EN (energy)), the Standard from the 2016 STE Massachusetts Curriculum Framework, the Item Description providing the details of what specifically was asked of students, and the points available for a given question, item Possible Points.\nSummary Performance Metrics:\n\nFor each item, the state reports the percentage of points earned by students at Rising Tide, RT Percent Points, the percentage of available points earned by students in the state, State Percent Points, and the difference between the percentage of points earned by Rising Tide students and the percentage of points earned by students in the state, RT-State Diff.\nLastly, SG9_CU306Dis and SG9_CU306NonDis are \\(3 \\times 5\\) dataframes consisting of summary performance data by Reporting Category for students with disabilities and without disabilities; most importantly including RT Percent Points and State Percent Pointsby disability status.\n\n\n\nHypothesis\n\n\n\nA school’s percent of student’s exceeding expectations on the Introductory Physics MCAS is negatively associated with variance in Mathematics and Data items.\nSchool’s mean performance diffs are not the same across science practice categories.\n\n\n\n\nDescriptive Statistics\n\n\nCode\n# HSPhy_NextGen_PerfDF\n# HSPhy_NextGen_SchoolIT301DF\n\n\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nKnuth, Donald E. 1984. “Literate Programming.” Comput.
