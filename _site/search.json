As early as 1989 there were calls to establish national curriculum standards as a way to improve student college and career readiness skills and close poverty gaps (Greer 2018). Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) tests were introduced as part of the Massachusetts Education Reform Act.\nThe MCAS tests are a significant tool for educational equity. Scores on the Grade 10 Math MCAS test “predict longer-term educational attainments and labor market success, above and beyond typical markers of student advantage. For example, among demographically similar students who attended the same high school and have the same level of ultimate educational attainment, those with higher MCAS mathematics scores go on to have much higher average earnings than those with lower scores.” (Papy 2020).\nWith the introduction of the new Common Core standards came the demand for appropriate curricular materials and teaching practices. Research indicates that the choice of instructional materials can have an impact “as large as or larger than the impact of teacher quality” (Chingos 2012). Massachusetts, along with Arkansas, Delaware, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Mexico, Ohio, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Texas belongs to the Council of Chief State School Officers’ (CCSO), High Quality Instructional Materials and Professional Development network with the stated goal of ensuring that “Every student everyday is engaged in meaningful, affirming, grade-level instruction, by ensuring that every teacher has access to high-quality, standards aligned instructional materials and receives relevant professional development to support their use of these materials, and recently released a Case Study outlining progress and policy guidance for ensuring teachers and students have access to High Quality Instructional Materials.\nSince all Massachusetts students must pass a High School science MCAS and school’s receive annual reports on student performance on the MCAS exams, student performance reports could be leveraged to provide schools guidance on curricular areas to support.\nconsidering Next Generation MCAS High School Introductory Physics student performance data, we hope to address the following broad questions:\n\n\n\nIs there a relationship between differences in student performance across Science Practice Categories and student achievement?\nHow can trends in student performance be used to identify Introductory Physics content areas in need of curricular adjustments?\n\n\nIn this report, I will analyze the High School Introductory Physics Next Generation Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) tests results for Massachusetts public schools.\nThe HSPhy_NextGenMCASDF data frame contains performance results from 112 public schools across the commonwealth on the Next Generation High School Introductory Physics MCAS, which was administered in the Spring of 2022 and 2023.\nFor each school, there are values reported for 256 different variables which consist of information from two broad categories\n\nSchool Characteristics: This includes the name of the school and the size of the school as determined by the number of students that completed the MCAS exam.\nScience Practice and Reporting Category Performance Metrics: This includes the Category Possible Points, which summarizes the amount of points available on the exams from a given Reporting or Practice category, the school’s percentage of points earned on items associated with each Practice Category (A. Investigations and Questioning, B. Mathematics and Data, and C. Evidence, Reasoning, and Modeling ) and Reporting Category(MF (motion and forces) WA (waves), and EN (energy)). Details about the Science content and practice categories can be found in the the 2016 STE Massachusetts Curriculum Framework.\nAggregate Performance metrics: This includes a school’s percentage of students at each of the four Performance Levels, (E: Exceeding Expectations, M: Meeting Expectations, PM: Partially Meeting Expectations, and NM: Not Meeting Expectations), as well as a school’s Average Scaled Score.\nSchool-State Diff metrics: For each performance metric, the School-State Diff metric reports the difference between the percentage of points earned by students at a given school, School Percent Points and the percentage of available points earned by students in the state State Percent Points.\n\nSee the HSPhy_NextGenMCASDF data frame summary and codebook for further details.\n\n\nHypothesis\n\n\n\nA school’s percent of student’s exceeding expectations on the Introductory Physics MCAS is negatively associated with variance in Mathematics and Data items.\nSchool’s mean performance diffs are not the same across science practice categories.\n\n\n\n\nDescriptive Statistics\nData of 112 schools performance on Next Generation HS Introductory Physics exam in Spring of 2022 and Spring of 2023. 87 of those schools tested students in both years and 25 of those schools only tested students in 1 of the 2 testing years.\n\n\nCode\n#HSPhy_NextGen_SchoolSum\nHSPhy_NextGen_SchoolSum&lt;-HSPhy_NextGen_SchoolSum%&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\nHSPhy_NextGen_SchoolSum\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nCode\n# HSPhy_NextGen_PerfDF\n# HSPhy_NextGen_SchoolIT301DF\n\nHSPhy_2023_SchoolSizeDF&lt;-read_excel(\"data/2023_Physics_NextGenMCASItem.xlsx\", skip = 1)%&gt;%\n  select(`School Name`, `School Code`, `Tested`)%&gt;%\n  mutate(`Tested` = as.integer(`Tested`))%&gt;%\n  select(`School Name`, `School Code`, `Tested`)\n\nHSPhy_2022_SchoolSizeDF&lt;-read_excel(\"data/2022_Physics_NextGenMCASItem.xlsx\", skip = 1)%&gt;%\n  select(`School Name`, `School Code`, `Tested`)%&gt;%\n  mutate(`Tested` = as.integer(`Tested`))%&gt;%\n  select(`School Name`, `School Code`, `Tested`)\n\n\nHSPhy_SchoolSize &lt;- rbind(HSPhy_2023_SchoolSizeDF, HSPhy_2022_SchoolSizeDF)%&gt;%\n  mutate(count = 1)%&gt;%\n  group_by(`School Name`, `School Code`)%&gt;%\n  summarise(count = sum(count),\n            `Tested` = sum(`Tested`))%&gt;%\n  mutate(`Tested Count` = round(`Tested`/count))%&gt;%\n  ungroup()\nHSPhy_SchoolSize\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nCode\nquantile &lt;- quantile(HSPhy_SchoolSize$`Tested Count`)\nHSPhy_Size&lt;-HSPhy_SchoolSize%&gt;%\n  mutate(`School Size` = case_when(\n    `Tested Count` &lt;= quantile[2] ~ \"Small\",\n    `Tested Count` &gt; quantile[2] &\n      `Tested Count` &lt;= quantile[3] ~ \"Low-Mid\",\n    `Tested Count` &gt; quantile[3] &\n      `Tested Count` &lt;= quantile[4] ~ \"Upper-Mid\",\n    `Tested Count` &gt; quantile[4] &\n      `Tested Count` &lt;= quantile[5] ~ \"Large\",\n  ))%&gt;%\n  mutate(`School Size` = recode_factor(`School Size`,\n                                            \"Small\" = \"Small\",\n                                            \"Low-Mid\" = \"Low-Mid\",\n                                            \"Upper-Mid\" = \"Upper-Mid\",\n                                            \"Large\" = \"Large\",\n                                            .ordered = TRUE))%&gt;%\n  select(`School Name`, `School Code`, `School Size`)\n\n\nHSPhy_Size\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nCode\nHSPhy_NextGen_SchoolSum&lt;-HSPhy_NextGen_SchoolSum%&gt;%\n  left_join(HSPhy_Size, by = c(\"School Name\" = \"School Name\", \"School Code\" = \"School Code\"))\nHSPhy_NextGen_SchoolSum\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nCode\n#summary(HSPhy_NextGen_SchoolSum)\nprint(summarytools::dfSummary(HSPhy_NextGen_SchoolSum,\n                         varnumbers = FALSE,\n                         plain.ascii  = FALSE,\n                         style        = \"grid\",\n                         graph.magnif = 0.70,\n                        valid.col    = FALSE),\n       method = 'render',\n       table.classes = 'table-condensed')\n\n\n\nData Frame Summary\nHSPhy_NextGen_SchoolSum\nDimensions: 112 x 38\n  Duplicates: 0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nStats / Values\nFreqs (% of Valid)\nGraph\nMissing\n\n\n\n\nSubject [character]\n1.
